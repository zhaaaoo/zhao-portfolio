                    Hey there, I'm Wang Zhao, a fourth-year computer science student at SUTD! 
                    For me, software development is more than code, it's a mind-expanding journey. The thrill of perpetual learning, the rush of conquering even the tiniest challenge is what fuels my passion.
                    During my leisure time, I find joy in both dancing and creating culinary delights in the kitchen. It's all about that rhythm on the dance floor and the sizzle in the pan! 💃🍳🌟                    </p>
